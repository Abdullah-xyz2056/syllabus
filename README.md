Python:

If Statements
Basic If Statement: Write a Python program that checks if a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero using an if-else statement.
Nested If Statement: Create a program that asks for the user's age and then uses nested if statements to determine if the user is a child (0-12 years), a teenager (13-19 years), or an adult (20 years and older).
If-Elif-Else: Write a Python function that takes a student's score as input and returns the grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the following ranges: A: 90-100, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: 0-59.
List
Basic List Operations: Write a Python program that creates a list of 5 elements, appends a new element, removes the third element, and prints the final list.
List Comprehension: Write a program that generates a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 using list comprehension.
List Slicing: Given a list of numbers, write a Python function that returns a new list with only the even-indexed elements.
Tuple
Creating Tuples: Write a Python program that creates a tuple containing different data types (int, string, float) and prints each element.
Tuple Packing and Unpacking: Write a Python function that takes multiple arguments and packs them into a tuple, then unpacks the tuple to print each value individually.
Immutability of Tuples: Explain with an example how tuples are immutable in Python. Try modifying a tuple element and observe what happens.
Set
Set Operations: Write a Python program that takes two sets of numbers and performs union, intersection, and difference operations, displaying the results.
Removing Duplicates: Given a list of numbers with duplicates, write a program that removes all duplicates using a set and prints the resulting unique numbers.
Checking Membership: Create a set of common English words and write a program that checks if a user-provided word is in the set.
User Input
Simple Input: Write a Python program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints a message saying "Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old."
Input with Type Conversion: Write a program that asks the user for two numbers, adds them together, and prints the result. Ensure the inputs are converted to integers.
Input Validation: Write a Python program that asks the user for a number and checks if it is a valid integer. If the input is not an integer, prompt the user to try again.
Conversion Data Type
String to Integer Conversion: Write a Python function that takes a string representing a number and converts it to an integer. If the conversion fails, the function should return None.
List to Set Conversion: Write a Python program that converts a list of elements into a set and prints both the list and the set.
Float to Integer Conversion: Create a function that converts a floating-point number to an integer, explaining the potential loss of precision with an example.
